This is an exercise working tic tac toe game in Python 2.7

Credits to Christian Thompson and his awesome Youtube tutorial. Also to Patrick Gillespie for the ascii art generator. 

Things to do:

- Make inputs according to Numpad Numbers.
- Keep the program running when a player inputs something rather than an int.


Feel free to improve or to take ideas. This is one of the basic questions they ask you to do in an interview. I got rejected because I couldn't do anything like this and even now that I wrote this I have not yet understood fully functions and variables. As long as you enter integers when asked for an X or O it should work on Python 2.7.
